Based on the requirements and information provided, here is the proposed architecture for the Python backend stack:

1. `main.py`: The entrypoint file for the backend stack.

2. `app.py`: Contains the Flask application and routes for the API.

3. `auth.py`: Handles authentication and authorization logic.

4. `database.py`: Handles the connection to the MySQL database.

5. `events.py`: Implements the events and delegates system.

6. `telemetry.py`: Handles the storage of telemetry events in the database and S3.

7. `dashboard.py`: Implements the dashboard functionality for analytics graphs.

8. `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

Now, let's go through each file and provide the code for each:

`main.py`
